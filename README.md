Website is using LESS preprocessor stylesheets. SO we need to run htmls in a server to see the styles applied

For more info about LESS : https://lesscss.org/

For Running a server on local machines:

Install node:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once installed - run the following command from the directory

node web-server.js

which will run a local server on Port 1118

visit : http://localhost:1118/index.html

to see the application
